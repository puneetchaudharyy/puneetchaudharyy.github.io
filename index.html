    <p> Software development process is the foundation of any software development project. It helps simplify the building process by dividing the work into smaller, parallel or sequential steps or sub-processes to simplify the work. This process is also called software development life cycle (SDLC). One of the more popular models used for software development is the Waterfall Method. This method divides the development process into analysis, design, implementation, testing, launch and maintenance. Although a popular approach, the waterfall method has some shortcomings. One of them is that it is very hard to get feedback on the project during the development. This is bad because the software being developed is for the larger public. This makes it harder to make changes in the program. Another approach is the spiral method which was introduced in 1988. The spiral method is a development cycle that combines the iterative development process model with elements of the waterfall method. This method has proven to work better than the previous Waterfall method.</p>
    <p></p>Software design is crucial in businesses and architecture. Building a software without a plan is like building a house without setting a foundation, it is bound to collapse. Software design helps with that. The main objectives of a software design model are to achieve correctness, efficiency, understandability, completeness and maintainability. Apart from this, software design ensures the traceability of the software which makes improving and making changes to the software when there is a bug easier. </p> 
    <p></p>PostgreSQL is one of the best engineered DBMS I have ever used. It makes database management really convenient and efficient. The interface is next to none and the concurrency and performance features are very helpful in parallelization of read queries and building B-tree indexes. Itâ€™s extensibility to languages like Python, Java and Rust was really helpful to me when I made JavaScript projects of my own. </p>
