    <p> Software development process is the foundation of any software development project. It helps simplify the building process by dividing the work into smaller, parallel or sequential steps or sub-processes to simplify the work. This process is also called software development life cycle (SDLC). One of the more popular models used for software development is the Waterfall Method. This method divides the development process into analysis, design, implementation, testing, launch and maintenance. Although a popular approach, the waterfall method has some shortcomings. One of them is that it is very hard to get feedback on the project during the development. This is bad because the software being developed is for the larger public. This makes it harder to make changes in the program. Another approach is the spiral method which was introduced in 1988. The spiral method is a development cycle that combines the iterative development process model with elements of the waterfall method. This method has proven to work better than the previous Waterfall method.</p>
    <p></p>Software design is crucial in businesses and architecture. Building a software without a plan is like building a house without setting a foundation, it is bound to collapse. Software design helps with that. The main objectives of a software design model are to achieve correctness, efficiency, understandability, completeness and maintainability. Apart from this, software design ensures the traceability of the software which makes improving and making changes to the software when there is a bug easier. </p> 
    <p></p>PostgreSQL is one of the best engineered DBMS I have ever used. It makes database management really convenient and efficient. The interface is next to none and the concurrency and performance features are very helpful in parallelization of read queries and building B-tree indexes. It’s extensibility to languages like Python, Java and Rust was really helpful to me when I made JavaScript projects of my own. </p>

      1.Requirements gathering is very important in the software development process. It ensures that the software is being built on the preferences and requirements of the user. This is vital because the software is going to be used by them. It also lays down a solid foundation and makes the objective of the program clearer. This step helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the stakeholders and end users, and that it is developed within the constraints of the project, such as budget and schedule.
      The requirements gathering stage starts with the team of developers sitting and discussing the main purpose of the software. They lay down the most basic requirements first and then proceed to decide on the more specific features or services that the user would benefit from.
      One of my favourite ways to do requirements gathering is through process maps and flowcharts. It gives a simplified depiction of the functionality we want to deploy. For e.g., If one wants to map their business processes, user flows and sometimes even for explaining their requirement gathering process to other members of the team or the stakeholders and even users.
      
      2.	User stories for PostgreSQL:
          a.	As a database manager, I should be able to see all the columns and their properties, so that I can make changes in the variable type, length of the entered value, etc.
          b.	As a teacher, I should be able to display the marks of students in chronological order according to different columns, so that I can identify which students are lacking and need more attention.
          c.	As a sales manager, I should be able to export and import data from other applications in potentially different formats, so that I can make changes as and when required.
          d.	As a user, I shall be able to protect my databases with a password, so that only authorised people can access it.
          e.	As a user, I want to know all the previous queries, so that I can go back to see the results and save time and also to identify any errors that I did while previously writing the query.

      Empathy in contrast to sympathy is understanding a person or a group of people’s subjective experience. This avoids the distance of pity as with sympathy. Empathy leads to deeper connections between people. Empathy is more than just a gut feeling because id so was the case we wouldn’t need surveys, focus groups, interviews, or ethnographies. The reason we do research is to objectively observe behaviours and explanations while balancing it with empathetic understanding. Empathy isn’t a tool limited to the world of design. It is a powerful tool for every professional. Cultivating empathy is vital for an organisation to have a realistic view of people’s lives. The top three models discussed in the chapter which lack empathy are Consumers, Home Economicus, and the Human factors. Consumers is probably the worst out of all as it narrows down people to just beings that consume products and services. The model is completely devoid of empathy and tells nothing about the characteristics or preferences of the user. The homo economicus model views human behaviour as a calculation to maximise utility. This model focuses on what prompts the user rather than on the user and their experience. These businesses focus on quantity rather than quality. The last model, called the “Human Factor” model did consider how the users used the products and services. While this was an improvement from the previous models, it still lacked some serious components of empathy. The view assumes everyone to be a robot who always has specific preferences. This classic “tasks and goals” viewpoint is too shallow to address all aspects of customer service. This is clear from the wide range of feature-rich but of no use products on the market.
